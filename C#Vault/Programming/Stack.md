## Overview
The stack is a part of the memory.
The stack grows as we add to it and decreases whe something is used.
When a type is instanciated the stack piles up, until the scope where the type was created ends. 

All value type are stored on the stack (unless they are encapsulated in classes).
References to reference types are also stored on the stack.
